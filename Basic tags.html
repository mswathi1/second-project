			 HTML is  not case sensitive means we can write tags in CAPITAL or SMALL or mix like BODY/BOdy
			 and no significance for WHITE SPACES.only one space will consider even we give more space
			 unlesss we use break statement
			 even we write content in different lines it will display in a single line.
			 If cotent is not enough to display in a line in browser then only displays in
			 new line.
			 so to display the text in new line we have to use <br>BREAK TAG : & it is empty/single tag not container/pair tags means no closing tag or this.
			 we can write break tag in 3 ways one already used  and remaining two are <br/> and another form is </br> any one of 3 can be used.
				<pre>
					 PRE TAG: means prefomated tag used to display the content as how we habe writtten in the document & also considers white spaces  because 
					 if we want to display 100 words in different lines it is difficult to use break in ecery line so if use pre tag then the way we write in
					 document dispays in browser asiit is.

						youtube
						Facebook
						Twitter   now white         spaces also considers in pre tag 
				</pre>
					   CODE TAG: when we want to insert any language code in a browser like java script/java/php we have to use code contaier tag.
					   The code we have written inside thsi tag will not be compiled just it will display in code format.
			   <pre>
			   <code>
						class new {
						public static void main(String srgs[]){
						System.out.println("WELCOME");
						}
						}
						
				</code>
				</pre>

				 To display titles/subtitles/headings  we use heading tags h1 to h6 h1 to h6 font size decreases& it displays as bold,for conatiner tags if we dont use
				 closing tag then that structure/format continuous untill we closing tag.
			    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
				<h2>Heading 2</h2>
				<h3>Heading 3 </h3>
				<h4>Heading 4</h4>
				<h5>Heading 5 </h5>
				<h6>Heading 6 </h6>
				
			 <p>PARAGRAPH TAG:It is conatiner tag it is used to display text in more readable format like for for stories/classes
			 we can use this tag.
			 </p>
			 <p>For each paragraph we have to use this tag</p>
